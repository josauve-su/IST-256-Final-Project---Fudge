Poster

• Both John and I collaborated on a poster idea and what material to include on it. We went step by step in Adobe Photoshop
 to create a poster we agreed on.

Video

•	For the video portion, I filmed while John explained our project and walked you through it in a short 2-minute video.

Code

•	For the coding portion John took over for most of it. We came together to talk about input into how we should organize
the code, what we should prompt the user with, and we brainstormed when there was a problem and how we would go about 
fixing it. John was the one who mainly fixed the problems and wrote the code for the project.
